# The GVD is ready!

## Horizons team publishes the game vision document of their game

### A detailed overview of features, mechanics, and intended audience for upcoming game

The Horizons team is excited to announce that they have published the GVD (Game Vision Document) for their upcoming game.
The GVD is an essential document that outlines the game's concept, target audience, features, and gameplay mechanics.
The team has been working hard over the past few months to define the vision for Axolotl project and bring it to life.
Axolotl Project is a code name or alias for an upcoming video game that is currently in development.
It is not the official name of the game and is only being used by the development team as a temporary placeholder
until the actual name is revealed.

In the coming weeks, the team plans to share more updates on the development of Axolotl, including progress on the game's
vertical slices. We invite everyone to follow our social media channels to stay up-to-date on the latest news and announcements.
The Horizons team is thrilled to share their journey with the community and can't wait to bring Axolotl project to life!

With the GVD now published, the team is one step closer to making their vision a reality. The document provides a detailed overview
of the game's core features and mechanics, as well as its intended audience and overall theme.
The Horizons team is excited to share their progress with the community and hopes that the GVD will provide insight into the upcoming game.
The team also acknowledges that the GVD is not set in stone and is subject to change as development progresses.
However, we hope that it provides a solid foundation for the game's development and gives players an idea of what to expect.
