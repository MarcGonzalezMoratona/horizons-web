# Axolotl project: the development starts

## Horizons Team begins development of Axolotl Project

### The project comes up to life

On March 14th, the Horizons team kicked off the development of their first delivery for Axolotl Project, a new video game.
The team, comprised of 24 students from the UPC School's first Master's Degree in Advanced Programming for AAA video games class,
has been preparing for this moment since they first met in October 2022. In the intervening months,
they've learned a great deal about 3D modelling, C++ programming, texturing, and game design.
A lot of things have been going on and now it's time to start applying knowledge to the real project.

### The first vertical slice

The first major milestone in the project is the creation of a "vertical slice" \- a playable prototype that lays the foundation for the game's structure. Over the past few weeks, the team has been hard at work on concept discovery, defining the game's art style, lore, and core functionality. The goal of this delivery is to present a playable prototype that showcases the game's core gameplay and application structure.

### Team methodology

To achieve this and subsequent milestones, the team has divided into several smaller teams, each with its own area of focus: Art, Engine, Game Design, Level Design, User Interface, Public Relations, Graphics, and Physics. Each team is led by a designated coordinator who manages tasks and ensures everyone is working together towards the same goals. Team members are encouraged to change roles between milestones to gain experience in different areas of the game development process.
